# Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains two projects focused on supervised learning techniques for classification tasks. The first project aims to predict handwritten digits (0-9) from grayscale image data, while the second compares various classification models on synthetic datasets.

## Project 1: Handwritten Digit Classification

Predict handwritten digits (0-9) using different supervised learning techniques and compare their performance.

### Models Tested & Results

- k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors): Best performance with 88.2% accuracy.

- Random Forest: Strong performance with 86.4% accuracy.

- Decision Tree with Depth Adjustment: Lower performance with 70.2% accuracy.

- Pruned Decision Tree: Least effective with 68.2% accuracy.

## Project 2: Synthetic Data Classification

Compare multiple classification models, including k-NN, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forests, for predicting class labels from synthetic data.

### Models Tested & Results

- k-NN: Best performance with 88.2% test accuracy, demonstrating consistency and reliability.

- Decision Trees:
   - Depth-adjusted: 70.2% accuracy.

   - Pruned: 68.2% accuracy.

- Naïve Bayes:

   - 4% training error, 5% test error, and 95% cross-validation accuracy. Good generalization capability.

- Random Forests:

   - 1% training error, 5% test error, and 93% cross-validation accuracy. More complex learning curves.
